# Smart Financial Management System

## 📖 Description
The **Smart Financial Management System** is an automated solution designed for SecureBank to assist in handling financial operations efficiently.

2. **Investment Risk Assessment**:
   - Classifies portfolios as High, Medium, or Low risk based on stock returns.

3. **Loan Repayment Tracker**:
   - Tracks loan balances as monthly payments are made.
   - Displays remaining balances interactively.

4. **Stock Price Monitoring**:
   - Tracks stock prices daily.
   - Stops monitoring when a target price is achieved.

5. **Currency Exchange Tracker**:
   - Monitors currency rates from PKR 290/USD to PKR 300/USD.
   - Prints daily exchange rates interactively.
